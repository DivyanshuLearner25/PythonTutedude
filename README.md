# PythonTutedude
Hey this is my first repo on Github as I am a Beginner in it.

                     # Assignment 1 
                     #Python course on Tutedude
# Task 1
1. I have created two variables (num1 and num2)to store user input in it,using input() function.
2. I have used int() typocasting to make sure that entered input by user is <class 'int'> means integer.
3. I have created four another variables - plus , subtract, multiply, division to perform mathematical operations on those two numbers taken on console by user.
4. In last ,I used print() function to print my output.
# Code (Task1)
num1=int(input("Enter first number : "))
num2=int(input("Enter second number : "))
plus =num1+num2
subtract=(num1-num2)
multiply=num1*num2
division=num1/num2
#print separately
"""print("Addition: ",plus)
print("Subtraction: ",subtract)
print("Multiplication:",multiply)
print("Division:",division)"""
#All output in one line
print("Addition:",plus,"\n Subtraction:",subtract,"\nMultiplication:",multiply,"\nDivision:",division)
# Output (Task1)
Enter first number : 10
Enter second number : 5
Addition: 15 
 Subtraction: 5 
Multiplication: 50 
Division: 2.0





# Task2
I created 2 variables first_name & last_name to store the first name and the last name of user. Then I used concanate variable to concatenate first and second varibles. At last using  print() function I printed my output.

# Code
first_name=input("Enter your first name :")
last_name=input("Enter your last name :")
concanate=first_name+" "+last_name
print("Hello",concanate,"! Welcome to the Python program.")

# Output
Enter your first name :Divyanshu
Enter your last name :Maurya
Hello Divyanshu Maurya ! Welcome to the Python program.
